possible to get from any city to any other city by using airlines.
Let’s say that the two cities are in a good relationship if it is possible to get from one to another using at
most x flights.
Additionally, let’s say that the set of k cities is friendly if all pairs of cities in it are in a good relationship.
You need to find the number of friendly sets of cities for each k, such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n. As these values
may be very large, find them modulo 998 244 353.Everyone knows that bit operations (e.g. bitwise XOR) are faster than recursive functions (such as the greatest
common divisor, GCD). To impress your internship supervisors you replaced, in the company’s flagship project,
all instances of 𝑔𝑐𝑑(𝑥, 𝑦) with much quicker 𝑥𝑜𝑟(𝑥, 𝑦).
That was yesterday, on Friday. Now you start thinking whether you should have tested your new code before
deploying to production... Well, better late than never. Given a sequence of numbers 𝑎1 , . . . , 𝑎𝑛 , determine how
many pairs (𝑖, 𝑗)  actually satisfy 𝑔𝑐𝑑(𝑎𝑖 , 𝑎𝑗 ) = 𝑥𝑜𝑟(𝑎𝑖 , 𝑎𝑗 ). Recall that 𝑔𝑐𝑑(𝑥, 𝑦) denotes the
greatest common divisor of 𝑥 and 𝑦, while 𝑥𝑜𝑟(𝑥, 𝑦) is the bitwise-XOR operation on 𝑥 and 𝑦</string>
