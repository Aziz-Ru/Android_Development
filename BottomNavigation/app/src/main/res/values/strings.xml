I want to save a file to the internal storage by getting the text inputted from EditText. Then I want the same file to return the inputted text in String form and save it to another String which is to be used later.Mob was hijacked by the mayor of the Town "TruthTown". Mayor wants Mob to count the total population of the town. Now the naive approach to this problem will be counting people one by one. But as we all know Mob is a bit lazy, so he is finding some other approach so that the time will be minimized. Suddenly he found a poll result of that town where N people were asked "How many people in this town other than yourself support the same team as you in the FIFA world CUP 2010?" Now Mob wants to know if he can find the minimum possible population of the town from this statistics. Note that no people were asked the question more than once
    In hashing there is a hash function that maps keys to some values. But these hashing functions may lead to a collision that is two or more keys are mapped to same value. Chain hashing avoids collision. The idea is to make each cell of hash table point to a linked list of records that have same hash function value.</string>
